# Pairwise Document Similarity Computation for Big Data
This project addresses a classic big data problem: calculating pairwise similarity between all documents in a large corpus. I have solved this problem using the similarity measure, Cosine similarity. I have demonstrated the sequential and parallel implementations to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the approach. The parallel implementation leverages distributed computing techniques to handle large datasets efficiently.
